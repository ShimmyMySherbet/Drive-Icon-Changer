A simple tool to change icons and labels of USBs or built-in drives. 

Automatically formats the icon from most common image types. Uses bicubic image shrinking and 7 different image sizes in the output icon for the best results.

## The Icon doesn't change, what do I do?

After you change the icon, windows caches the thumbnail for the drive. This means that it's not retriving the new icon from the USB or Drive. The solution to fix this, is emptying
window's thumbnail cache. This can be done through the Disck Clean-Up utility. There is a shortcut to this tool in the help menu, accessed through the 'Help' button.
